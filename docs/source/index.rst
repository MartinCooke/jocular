Welcome to Jocular's documentation!
===================================

**Jocular** is a tool that supports astronomical observing using a camera and telescope or lens.

Jocular's principal use is the observation of astronomical objects in near real-time by connecting a camera to a telescope or suitable lens. Jocular also supports session-planning through extensive deep sky object (DSO) databases, helps to manage your captures, enables the reloading of previously-captured images, and can be used to annotate your images.

The philosophy behind Jocular is to allow the user to focus on observing, by presenting a minimal, distraction-free interface and a recompute strategy that allows most decisions -- apart from where to point the scope -- to be reversed during the course of the observation itself.
