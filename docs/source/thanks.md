# Thanks

Jocular has benefitted enormously from interactions with fellow amateur astronomers, particularly Bill S, Mike JW, Callump, Zak, Grant Privett, London David & CatBurglar.

I'd particularly like to thank

* **AKB** for developing what I'm calling *Tony's Noise Reduction (TNR)* for Jocular

* **Steve in Boulder** for several useful code additions, including shortcuts and the ability to move annotation labels

Thank you!
