# Jocular

Jocular is a tool for *Electronically-Assisted Astronomy* (EEA).

Jocular supports the observation of astronomical objects in near real-time by connecting up a camera to a telescope or suitable lens. It also supports session-planning through extensive deep sky object (DSO) databases, helps to manage your captures, and
enables the reloading of previously-captured images.

Jocular is a cross-platform application. It has been used extensively on OSX and Windows but ought to work on Linux variants too. 

This is the first public release although the application has been in use for some time. Further documentation will be added over the coming days.

### Requirements
 
Jocular requires a recent Python 3 system. To check whether you already have a suitable system, open a command window (Windows) or terminal (OSX/Linux) and type

	python --version

If the version is 3.4 or later you are all ready. If not, visit <python.org> to download a version appropriate for your operating system.



### Installation

In your command or terminal window, type:

	pip install jocular
