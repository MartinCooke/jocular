# Jocular

Jocular is a tool for *Electronically-Assisted Astronomy* (EEA).

Jocular supports the observation of astronomical objects in near real-time by connecting up a camera to a telescope or suitable lens. It also supports session-planning through extensive deep sky object (DSO) databases, helps to manage your captures, and
enables the reloading of previously-captured images.  

This is the first public release although the application has been in use for some time. Further documentation will be added over the coming days.
